      <h1 class="questioncopy">You wake up on a rainy street, dimly lit by neon signs.
        You walk, taking in your surroundings until a croaky voice grabs your attention.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's an old man, wearing a dirty apron.
        He pushes you inside his hole-in-the wall shop, shooing you into the kitchens with a list of tasks. What do you
        do?
        <div class="choice" onclick="window.location.href='page2.html'" onMouseEnter="tick.play()">
          <h1 class="choicelink">The sink is full of dishes, the floor is dirty, and the rice needs cooking.
            You roll up your sleeves with determination and get straight to work.

            When the old man is distracted, you take the chance to try and sneak out the back door.</h1>
